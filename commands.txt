Running Python Backend with Uvicorn:

Make sure youâ€™re in your project folder (the one with backend.py):
    cd /path/to/your/project

Activate your virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate

Launch the backend with Uvicorn
    uvicorn backend:app --reload


Running the Frontend:

Option 1: Open HTML directly via live server.
    Fetch requests to the backend may fail (CORS) if opened this way.

Option 2: Run local web server
    python3 -m http.server 5500

    if running locally on the same machine: 
    http://localhost:5500 or http://127.0.0.1:5500

    if running on another device on the same network:
        you need your local IP 
        suppose your IP is 192.168.1.10, the link would be:
            http://192.168.1.10:5500
