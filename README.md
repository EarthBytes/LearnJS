# LearnJS

**LearnJS** is an interactive chatbot designed to help you learn JavaScript in a natural, conversational way.  

Whether you’re just starting out or looking to deepen your knowledge, LearnJS can:  
- Answer questions  
- Explain concepts  
- Provide practical examples  
- Guide you through debugging problems (in the future)

## Features

- **Ask about JavaScript concepts**  
  _e.g., “What is an object?”_

- **Code Examples**  
  The bot can show practical code snippets when you ask (or when you reply “yes” to a prompt).  

- **Synonyms & Flexible Language**  
  Understands different ways of phrasing a question (e.g., “function” vs “functions”).  

- **Intent Detection**  
  Recognises question types such as:  
  - Definitions  
  - Examples  
  - Step-by-step “how-to” guides  
  - Comparisons  
  - Troubleshooting (errors, debugging help)  
  - General discussion  

- **Interactive Responses**  
  If the bot offers more detail or an example, you can simply reply _yes/no_.  

- **Context Awareness**  
  Keeps track of the last few turns in conversation for smoother interaction.  

- **Natural Small Talk**  
  Responds naturally if you ask it “how are you?” or similar.  

- **Multi-topic Support**  
  If you ask about more than one concept at once, it provides a breakdown and lets you choose what to focus on.
