Running Python Backend with Uvicorn:

Make sure youâ€™re in your project folder (the one with backend.py):
    cd /path/to/your/project

Activate your virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate

Launch the backend with Uvicorn
    uvicorn backend:app --reload


Running the Frontend:

Option 1: Open HTML directly via live server.
    Fetch requests to the backend may fail (CORS) if opened this way.

Option 2: Run local web server
    python3 -m http.server 5500
