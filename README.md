# LearnJS
LearnJS is an interactive chatbot designed to help you learn JavaScript in a natural, conversational way.

Whether you’re just starting out or want to deepen your knowledge, LearnJS can answer questions, explain concepts, provide examples and guide you through debugging problems.

Features
- Ask about JavaScript concepts (_e.g., “What is an object?”_).
- The bot can show practical code snippets when you ask (or when you say “yes” after a prompt).
- Synonyms & Flexible Language – Understands multiple ways of phrasing a question (“function” vs “functions”).
- Intent Detection – Recognises question types:
    - Definitions
    - Examples
    - How-to / step-by-step
    - Comparisons
    - Troubleshooting (errors, debugging help)
    - General discussion
- If the bot offers more detail or an example, you can reply yes/no.
- Keeps track of the last few turns in conversation for smoother context.
- Handles typos and near-miss keywords to still give useful answers.
- Responds naturally if you ask it “how are you?” or similar.
- If you ask about more than one concept at once, it gives you a breakdown and lets you choose what to focus on.


Future Plans
- Paste in your JavaScript code and LearnJS will identify issues and explain why it’s wrong.
- Receive human-like feedback on how to fix mistakes.
- Test your knowledge directly in chat.
